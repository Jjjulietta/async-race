## **Transcript**

Hello! My name is Julia. I am from Belarus and live in Minsk.
I am currently studying at RS School to become a frontend developer.
Previously, I graduated from the Belarusian State Economic University and have worked as an economist for quite a few years.


At work, I liked to solve problems related to the implementation of projects and the description of processes. But after reaching the set goals, the work became quite routine. Over the past few years, I began to think about changing my profession and learning to program. This is not an easy decision, but objective circumstances helped me to make it.


I started to look through the programs of various courses, but then I decided to study on my own, since there are a lot of training videos and educational sites on the Internet.But with self-study, it is difficult to properly organize the process itself and there is no control over knowledge. When I came to study at RS School to stage 1, I realized that I did not have enough practice in order to successfully complete the assignments. And I went to stage 0. I regret not knowing about the school earlier and wasting a whole year. There is a well-structured program that allows you to upgrade your skills on real projects, as well as a grading system that encourages you to study successfully. In addition, the community is great, students actively help and support each other  and  learning in a group is always fun. I think I'll be sad when the training is over.


Why did I decide to become a programmer and chose frontend?
I have already said that at work I liked to participate in projects, including jointly with programmers for the implementation of certain products. Also solve problems that require a creative approach, for example, when describing the economic structure of an enterprise. However, there are few such jobs in the field of economics, and I thought, why not try my hand at programming. I chose frontend because, firstly, I like that the result is presented in the form of visual content, and secondly, that you can see the result of the work immediately. It's very exciting. I love to draw and I like the creative approach to work, and the development process is a creative process, in addition, the developer can sometimes choose design solutions on his own.


It is difficult for me to name the project that interested me the most. When I work on the next RS project, it seems to me the most interesting, because it allows me to solve some new problems, learn something new and in the end be amazed, did I manage to do it. Each time it is a small victory and many, many positive emotions. It's great to learn and create. Learning from projects is interesting and productive. If someone had told me half a year ago that I would be able to write a game, honestly, I would not have believed it.


I hope that the knowledge gained will allow me to get a job and start a career in the field of programming.
As for soft skills, the experience of working with various people allowed me to develop such an important skill as the ability to work in a team and successfully solve tasks.


I would like to improve English, which is indispensable in IT. I studied French at school. Later I studied English in courses up to A2 level. But since I had no practice, I almost forgot everything. Now, along with the study of programming, I began to learn English again.


Finally, I would like to tell about my hobbies. I love being in nature and I am fond of birdwatching, besides, a couple of years ago I realized my dream and bought a camera for hunting. Now one of the most favorite activities is to get out into nature and take pictures of birds. As well, in my free time I like to draw.


Thank you for your attention! Bye!
